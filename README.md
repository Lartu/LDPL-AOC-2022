# LDPL Advent of Code 2022

[2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solved in [LDPL](https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl).

## Why
I'm solving these challenges just to test [LDPL 4.5](https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl/pull/208) to
make sure it's a viable release candidate.

Don't expect me to complete every one of these puzzles. 
I know I will not follow through with this, I never do.

## Licence
Every single line of code in this repo is yours if you want it. Merry christmas!
